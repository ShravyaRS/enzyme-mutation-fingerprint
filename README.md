# Enzyme Mutation Fingerprint Analysis

This project focuses on **mutation resilience analysis** in enzymes using **binary fingerprint encoding** and **dual mutation co-impact matrices**. The two enzymes analyzed are:

- **Lysyl Oxidase (LOX)** ‚Äì involved in connective tissue cross-linking
- **Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD)** ‚Äì key in neurotransmitter GABA synthesis

## Project Overview
## Enzyme Mutation Fingerprint Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing mutations in two enzymes, **Lysyl Oxidase (LOX)** and **Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD)**, to study mutation resilience. We use **binary fingerprint encoding** to analyze amino acid changes and **mutation co-impact matrices** to identify the most critical mutation hotspots.

The project includes:
- **Enzyme sequence analysis** and **mutation prediction** using structural data.
- **3D visualization** of enzymes with mutation highlights.
- **Tools to compare mutation impacts** across enzyme structures.

üìä Mutation Fingerprint Concept
Each amino acid is assigned a fixed-length binary vector representing:
Polarity
Charge
Hydrophobicity
Size
These fingerprints enable:
Easy comparison of mutational impacts
Co-impact matrix generation across enzyme domains

üìå Future Scope
Integrate AlphaFold2 predicted mutations
Predict disease-linked residue vulnerability
Extend to multi-enzyme mutation resilience clusters

üî¨ Mutation Visualization
This project includes visualization tools that allow you to observe mutations on the 3D structures of enzymes.
Py3Dmol: A Python-based visualization tool that renders enzyme structures and highlights mutated residues.
Steps to Visualize:
Run scripts/visualize_pdb.py to load and visualize enzyme structures.
Mutations are highlighted in a distinct color to show their positions on the enzyme.
You can rotate and zoom in the 3D view to better analyze mutation impacts.


üî¨ Mutation Visualization
This project includes tools to visualize mutations on the 3D structures of enzymes, aiding in the identification of mutation-sensitive regions and structure-preserving zones.

üß™ Tools Used
Py3Dmol: A Python-based visualization tool that renders enzyme structures and highlights mutated residues.

üñºÔ∏è How to Visualize Mutations
Run the Visualization Script: Execute the scripts/visualize_pdb.py script to load and visualize the enzyme structures.

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/visualize_pdb.py
Input Files: The script requires the following input files:
A PDB file containing the enzyme structure (e.g., 1SIX.pdb).
A list of mutations to be visualized.

Output: The script generates an interactive 3D visualization of the enzyme structure with mutated residues highlighted in a distinct color.
Interactive Exploration: Users can rotate and zoom in the 3D view to better analyze mutation impacts.
