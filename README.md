# enzyme-mutation-fingerprint
This repository provides a framework for predicting enzyme mutation resilience using binary fingerprint encoding and dual mutation co-impact matrices. Applied to TPH1 and PAH, it offers tools to identify mutation-sensitive regions, structure-preserving zones, and compensatory mutation pairs.
